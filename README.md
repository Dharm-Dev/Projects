This project is a simple prototype for the library management system at admin end.
This project has some features as mentioned below:
1. Admin can add and delete the books as well as members available in the library.
2. Admin can list the total books and members available.
3. Admin has right to delete the members from the library only if his or her previous dues are clear.
4. Admin can manage the record of issue and return of the books by the members.
5. Admin can check the number of books issued to a particular member.

Restrictions to use some functionality:
a. Admin can't use return book facility unless a single user is available.
b. Admin can't use add members functionality if there is no book in the library records. so,firstly he needs to add book in the library.
